# Titanfist, T.I.T.A.N, and O.D.Y.S.S.E.U.S.

Titanfist ist the beginning of a whole new generation of CyberSecurity Tools. These will replace the industry-leading variations of tools that exist.
These tools will go on a Operating System called T.I.T.A.N, a universally accessible operating that can be used on any platform. The general idea of this 
operating system is keep it universal. This operating system will be universal, although we are accepting help, do note that this project will begin being open-source,
and down-the-line be forked into something proprietary. 

Just as clarficiation:

We shall keep the doors of this project open as long as possible, even after the forking of the project. As, we are a proponent of opensource and hope to become
the primary sponsor of the project. Eventually this will be what allows for this project to have it's paid maintainers.

The more that we work on this project, the more we advance GNU/Linux. Because, frankly, this will be a whole new distrobuton network for Linux. As, we are moving to 
what we are calling decentralized and virtualized kernels, "DAVK" for short. These kernels will be hosted in secrecy to make sure that no one attempts to tamper with them.
I utmost promise that we will have a team around the clock making sure these kernels are safe. T.I.T.A.N is not only going to be a security-based operating system, it is 
also going to have a cousin called "O.D.Y.S.S.E.U.S" who will be there to perform the heroic act of being the everyday variant for everyday users like you. 

I am hoping that this project is going to last, as it seems to be something worth doing.

Sincerely,

The Primary Maintainer,

Johnathan Spiva
